For the past two months, I've been actively diving into the field of cybersecurity — with a strong focus on penetration testing.

This is where I share my projects, tools, progress, and achievements.  
My primary programming language is Python, but ever since I started reading  
**"Hacking: The Art of Exploitation" by Jon Erickson**, I've also begun studying C to deepen my understanding of low-level exploitation.

You can track most of my practical results on the TryHackMe platform, where I go by the nickname <a href="https://tryhackme.com/p/KRY" style="text-decoration: none;">KRY</a>.  
My current goal is to earn the **OSCP certification** — a major milestone on my path.
